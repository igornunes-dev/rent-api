# Rent Management API ðŸš€

## ðŸ“– About The Project

This is a complete and robust RESTful API developed in Java with Spring Boot to manage the entire lifecycle of property rentals. The platform is designed to be the backend for a system that connects property **Owners** and **Tenants**, orchestrating everything from property listing to the management of contracts and monthly payments.

The project is built following software development best practices, including a well-defined service architecture, robust unit tests, and REST API design principles like **HATEOAS**.

-----

## âœ¨ Core Features

  * **User Management**: Full CRUD for Owners and Tenants, with a role and permission system.
  * **Property Management**: Owners can list, update, and remove their properties, which have a status of `AVAILABLE` or `RENTED`.
  * **Contract Lifecycle System**:
      * Create contracts linking an Owner, a Tenant, and a Property.
      * Manage the contract lifecycle with statuses: `ACTIVE`, `EXPIRED`, `TERMINATED`.
  * **Automated Payment Engine**:
      * Automatic generation of all monthly payment installments when a contract is created.
      * Manage the payment lifecycle with statuses: `PENDING`, `PAID`, `OVERDUE`, `CANCELED`.
  * **Security**: Authorization logic to ensure that only authorized users can perform sensitive actions (e.g., only the contract's owner can confirm a payment).
  * **Hypermedia-driven API (HATEOAS)**: API responses include links to the next possible actions, making the API more discoverable and self-descriptive.
  * **Dynamic API Documentation (Swagger)**: The API is fully documented using the OpenAPI 3 standard, generating an interactive interface with Swagger UI.

## ðŸ“„ API Documentation (Swagger)

The API is self-documented using the OpenAPI standard. After starting the application, you can access the interactive Swagger UI to view all endpoints and models, and to test the API calls directly in your browser.
